# Deque

- A double ended queue in python
- That is, elements can be added or removed from both front and rear directions.
- When inserting or removing elements by accessing both ends of the container, this operation takes O(n) for a general list, whereas for a deque, it takes O(1). It is possible.

### Using a Deque

```python
from collections import deque

deq = deque() #[]

deq.append(0) #[0]
deq.appendLeft(10) #[10,0]
deq.popLeft() #[0]
deq.pop() #[]
```
